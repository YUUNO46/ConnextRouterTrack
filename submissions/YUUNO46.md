Feedback: I have a problem when I try to Add liquidity with Kovan chain it fail, Not sure it's downtime or not but It work when I try later.
          I also a little bit confuse with the submission on github not sure the project had some official guide. I'm new with this thing my bad U_U 
          Also I think the Update on 24/05/2022 feel like it faster than before.


2. Choose the activity which you intend to work on over the course of the program
    I want to try a every test on connext testnet & website 
    helping other run routers.
    And make a Medium to summarize How to do this thing (TH language) . I have plane for video but I'm not good at it but will try. 


3. Answer questions and help others to run router in this Discord channel 
   I mostly learn from my friend in discord, 'm a newbie. But since I pass through the mission I can help others.
   I answer some question to my friend (our community) and Thai channel (Connext discord) about connext and router test.
